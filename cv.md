## Code Examples

### Example 1: Training a Machine Learning Model with scikit-learn (Python)

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate accuracy
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

```

### Example 2: Asynchronous Web Scraping (JavaScript)

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');

class WebScraper {
    // Function to scrape top repositories from GitHub
    async scrapeTopRepositories() {
        try {
            const response = await axios.get('https://github.com/trending');
            const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);

            const repositories = $('.Box-row').map((i, elem) => ({
                name: $(elem).find('h3').text().trim(),
                description: $(elem).find('p').text().trim(),
                stars: $(elem).find('a.muted-link').first().text().trim()
            })).get();

            return repositories.slice(0, 5);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error during scraping:', error);
            return [];
        }
    }

    // Function to display trending repositories
    async displayTrending() {
        const repos = await this.scrapeTopRepositories();
        console.log('üî• Top 5 GitHub Repositories:');
        repos.forEach((repo, index) => {
            console.log(`${index + 1}. ${repo.name}`);
            console.log(`   üìù ${repo.description}`);
            console.log(`   ‚≠ê ${repo.stars} stars\n`);
        });
    }
}

// Run the scraper
const scraper = new WebScraper();
scraper.displayTrending();

```
